Deep Reinforcement Learning with Soft Actor Critic model for jetbot

This is my first attempt to implement a deep reinforcement model for the jetbot:

For this, it has attached a camera and six buttons as sensors.

This is an implementation of a SAC agent (Soft Actor Critic) with pytorch.

The goal is that the robot can drive as long as possible without collision with obstacles.

I don't use any simulation for this (like gym) but I want the robot to start learning from zero.

Hope it works :)
